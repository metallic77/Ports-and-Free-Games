                       ** SPECIAL HOLIDAY EDITION **
               
               Version 1.3 from Epic MegaGames (Member ASP)
=============================================================================

Description:

   This is a special CHRISTMAS EDITION of the ultra-popular arcade
   game Jazz Jackrabbit!  It features THREE of the best, all-new
   Jazz levels yet, three new 3D bonus stages, animation,
   and a rockin' holiday sound track.  The action is just as fast
   and furious as the original Jazz which has won the hearts of
   gamers around the world.

   Jazz Jackrabbit has become one of the most popular scrolling
   PC arcade games ever -- PC Format Magazine gave Jazz the award for
   "Best arcade game of the year"!

   PC Gamer Magazine said Jazz "simply oozes professionalism and
   style... A top quality game by any standards".

John Dvorak in PC Magazine (November 8, 1994) said:

  "Do you like fast-paced hot games such as that Sonic the Hedgehog
  game on the Sega? Look no further than Jazz Jackrabbit--an absolutely
  stunning PC-based arcade-style game every bit as good as anything
  found on a dedicated game machine."
