The Story
=========
   
  Remember the Tortoise and the Hare?
  
  3000 years later, they're still at it!

  The notorious leader of the turtle terrorists,  Devan Shell, has
  kidnapped the beloved rabbit princess, Eva Earlong, and has
  inhabited the galaxy with his looting goons!  Is all hope lost
  for the galactic rabbits?

  No way!

  Enter: Jazz Jackrabbit!

  The fate of planet Carrotus is in the hands of one lone rabbit!  It's
  up to you to rescue Eva Earlong and prevent Devan Shell from financing
  his maniacal plot of turtle domination by swiping the goods out from
  under his slimy beak.
  
  There is one only rule to remember while exploring -- if you
  can't collect it,  shoot it!

=======================================================
GAME STRATEGIES -- FOLLOW 'EM AND MAYBE YOU'LL SURVIVE!
=======================================================

You're about to play an action-adventure game starring a little bunny
with a big gun.  Your objective can be summed up like this:

  1. Collect everything.  There is a new kind of treasure in every level
     to satisfy your appetite for loot.

  2. If it moves, shoot it.  If it doesn't move,  what the heck -- shoot
     it anyway!
        
  3. Find and shoot the checkpoint signs. 

     The checkpoints mark out areas that the Turtles have claimed. When Jazz
     shoots these signs, it means that the area now belongs to the rabbits!
     Yeah! There are two of these signs in each level. The first one is
     halfway in and the second is at the end.  If you shoot the first
     checkpoint then later lose all of your health, you will return to that
     point instead of having to navigate the entire area again.

Other survival tips:

  * Be careful when you're about to jump into an area you can't see. There
    may be baddies swarming everywhere!

  * When in doubt, SHOOT.

  * Don't collect carrots if your energy is full; remember where they are
    should you need them later.

  * Conserve ammunition!

  * When in doubt, SHOOT.

  * Look for secret areas!  There are tons of them in every level.

  * The faster Jazz runs, the higher Jazz jumps. When his feet are blurry
    he is going fast and can jump very high. Use this to find hidden stuff!

  * Collect as many "Rapid Fire" guns as you can. If you collect 10 or
    more, Jazz will have immense firepower!

  * If you find an AirBoard then be sure to backtrack through the parts of
    the level you have already seen; you may be able to reach hidden areas
    with it!

  * Did we mention SHOOT?

  special weapons if he has collected ammunition for them. See "WEAPONS" for 
  more information.

  <ESC> Puts you in a menu of useful options.

  <T> Slow-Motion. For those who cannot handle Jazz's incredible speed, the

===========================================
The Status Panel -- Keep yourself informed!
===========================================

  This shows vital statistics during gameplay. In other words, it might
  help to sometimes look down here.  Some of this information is:

  Health: Jazz's energy and life force. Every time Jazz is hit by a bad guy
  he will lose some health. When Jazz runs out of health he will lose a
  life. You can get extra health by collecting carrots. Yum!

  Jazz: How many tries you have before your game is over. Every time you
  lose all of your health he will lose a life. You can get an extra life by
  collecting 1-UPS (a floating picture of Jazz's big green head) or by
  clearing a 3D bonus stage. (See BONUS STAGES!)

  Score: This shows how well you are doing. Jazz earns points by destroying
  baddies and scenery and collecting treasure. He can also earn points by
  completing a level with plenty of time remaining.

  Time: How long Jazz has to complete the area he is currently in. Run out of
  time and you will lose one JAZZ. Jazz can earn extra time by collecting 
  hourglasses. Hurry up!

  Weapon Picture: This shows the current weapon Jazz is firing. Jazz can change
  weapons by pressing ALT or FIRE + UP on Joysticks. Weapon ammunition
  is scattered *everywhere* in the game. See "WEAPONS" for more information.

==========================================
JAZZ'S ARSENAL - BIG WEAPONS FOR A BIG GUN
==========================================

  Jazz has four basic weapons available to him plus several special
  weapons.  Jazz's LFG-2000 Blaster is already equipped to fire most
  kinds of conventional fire-power.  But, he needs ammunition to
  fuel these special weapons. 

  Ammunition comes in quantities of 2 or 15. Find an orb for 2 shots, or
  shoot a Weapon Container with an orb inside it for 15 shots. 

  Remember, Jazz can change weapons (if he has ammunition) by pressing ALT or 
  FIRE + UP on the joystick. 

  Some of the weapons Jazz can kick butt with are:

  Blaster: The basic, wimpy weapon. Jazz has unlimited ammunition of this
  tiny bullet. Find some better ammunition FAST or Jazz will be a goner!

  Toaster: Find RED ORBS to fuel the red-hot TOASTER! The Toaster flies in a
  horizontal path and is much larger and quicker than the Blaster.

  RF Missile: Find GREEN ORBS to fuel the super-fast RF MISSILE! The RF 
  Missile fires TWO shots at once in a "V" path. Great all-purpose shot for 
  hitting foes above and below.

  Launcher: Find BLUE ORBS to fuel the crazy LAUNCHER! The BBT Launcher
  is made up of a TOP SECRET new substance similar to plastic explosives.
  However, instead of plastic explosive, the LAUNCHER is made of a RUBBER 
  EXPLOSIVE! It bounces along a horizontal path until it comes to a slope
  and will destroy all in its way.

=====================================
SPECIAL WEAPONS FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS
=====================================

If Jazz searches carefully enough he will locate Special Weapons. 
Some of these weapons are:

  TNT (Episodes 2-6 only): Perhaps the most powerful weapon in Jazz's
  arsenal. Collect floating charges to stock up on it. A very rare
  item hidden in several planets, it will eradicate all enemies within
  range in a brilliant flash of light!

  Rapid Fire: Collect floating guns to give Jazz's weapon RAPID FIRE!  Hold 
  down the fire button to spew forth a torrent of Jazz's current weapon. The 
  more RAPID FIRES that Jazz finds, the faster he will automatically shoot!

==================================
POWER-UPS AND OTHER GROOVY GOODIES
==================================

  Jazz can find a multitude of power-ups to aid in his mission. Some of
  these power-ups include:

  JUMP AROUND: Collect red spring-shoes to increase Jazz's jumping abilities.
  The more you find, the higher he leaps!

  HIP HOPS: The turtles have a particular taste for bird so they have
  captured these rare half-pheasant/half-eagles for supper. If Jazz frees
  one of them by shooting its cage,  the bird will be Jazz's companion
  until Jazz is hit by a baddie. HIP HOPS will fire at will, destroying
  all who attempt to harm their savior Jazz!

  FAST FEET: Shoot one of these icons and Jazz will have super speed for 20
  seconds! Run as far and as fast as you can when you find FAST FEET!

  FALLEN STARS: Collect a fallen star and Jazz will be invulnerable to all
  attacks for 15 seconds.

  GIANT GEM: Find a GIANT GEM and jazz will be transported to the bonus stage
  when he clears the level!  See BONUS STAGE for more info.

  AIRBOARD: Find the AirBoard and Jazz will jump on it. He can now fly 
  anywhere he chooses! Yeahoo!

  SHIELD: Shoot the Shield icon and Jazz will be protected by rotating gems 
  for one hit.

  FIRESHIELD: Shoot this and Jazz will be protected by the fire gems,
  which protect Jazz from four hits.

  1UP: Find one of these and you'll be awarded an extra life! They are very
  rare and look like a floating bunny head.

  CARROT: Find a Carrot to replenish Jazz's lost health.

  HOURGLASS: Gives you some extra time to secure the area you're in. You'll
  need these if you're playing on HARD or TURBO, where there's a time-limit!

=====================================================
NATURAL HAZARDS AND "THINGS THAT MAKE YOU GO BOUNCE!"
=====================================================

  Beware of Spikes, Cacti, and anything else that looks sharp.

  If Jazz finds a sign post with a check mark on it, shoot it! Jazz will
  return to this spot if he later runs out of energy.

  Springs are everywhere, so use them to your advantage to reach higher
  ground.

  There are BIG magnets on certain levels!  Use them to your advantage.

  Certain floors are "One-Way"; Jazz can jump through them but cannot fall
  through them. Beware of traps with these floors!

============
BONUS STAGES
============

  If Jazz is lucky enough to find an oversized red gem, he will be
  transported to the 3D BONUS STAGE when he clears the level!  Here, Jazz
  must find Power Gems that Devan has stashed.  If Jazz finds enough Power
  Gems, he'll earn an extra life!

  Keyboard Controls:

    <ALT> Jump.

    <SPACE> Roll. Jazz will curl up into a ball and zoom along the landscape.
    HINT: Be careful when using this! Jazz may gain speed, but he also loses
    some control!

    <UP> Jazz runs forward.
    <LEFT> Jazz turns and runs towards the left.
    <RIGHT> Jazz turns and runs right.

    <F1> Adjust the "detail level" of the bonus stage.  If Jazz is running
    slowly, press this to speed it up.  The game will run much faster,
    and you'll only lose a little bit of graphical detail

  Watch out for:

  EXIT SIGNS: These will kick Jazz right out of the bonus stage,
  regardless of his time remaining! Avoid at all costs!

  HOURGLASSES: These will extend your time in the bonus stage a bit.

  BLUE GEMS: Treasure that Devan has hidden in these strange 3D landscapes.
  Grab as many as you can!

  BOUNCEPADS: Reverse gravity spots on the playfield that will send Jazz
  flying into the air.                                                   

  SPINMEISTERS: Step on one of these and Jazz will be turned around and 
  around!

  WATER and GOOP:  These slow Jazz down, so avoid them!

===============================
EPISODES -- THE SAGA CONTINUES!
===============================

Episode 1: TURTLE TERROR!

  In this Episode, Jazz begins his war on the malicious turtles. The 
  planets he must conquer are:
 
  DIAMONDUS -- A beautiful grassland planet with a healthy atmosphere and
  plenty of goodies. However, the turtles know this also and are pillaging
  the land as we speak! Beware of bees and look for secret passages by
  shooting walls! Can you find the hidden Birdland in level 2?

  TUBELECTRIC -- This planet is full of electronic mayhem. Once a giant
  munitions factory, it was abandoned after a freak accident involving
  one of the nuclear reactors. Jump in the Transport Tubes to move to
  different areas.
 
  MEDIVO -- The atmosphere of this ghostly planet is incredibly thick;
  so thick that it is constantly raining on the surface. The planet
  is covered with enormous marble ruins which hold many secrets. Look
  out for spikes and ghost swords.

Episode 2: BALLISTIC BUNNY

  After securing the first three planets, Jazz's skills have improved greatly.
  He quickly discovers a highly advanced area of the galaxy where Devan is
  building a battleship to destroy Jazz's home planet.  Jazz must destroy
  everything he sees.
  
  Jazz will go ballistic on:

  LETNI -- This is Devan's ENORMOUS supercomputer designed for building
  battleships, destroyers, and figuring out where to get lunch on a
  rainy Tuesday afternoon. Beware of magnets and "bugs" in the system.

  TECHNOIR -- Bathed in a choking red atmosphere, this planet has NO plant
  life upon it. In fact, the turtles are the only organic creatures here.
  They have secured their areas with tanks, missiles, and floating mines.
  Be very careful, it's a war zone out there!

  ORBITUS -- Because of the odd structure of this planet, the turtles have had
  difficulty inhabiting most of it. It is an elaborate structure of pipes,
  anti-gravity floors and bounce-walls. Jazz will bounce around most of the 
  time he's visiting Orbitus.

Episode 3: RABBIT'S REVENGE

  Jazz receives a fax from Princess Eva in her cell:  "JAZZ: LUCKY I BROUGHT
  MY PORTA-FAX WITH ME, HUH?  DEVAN IS REGROUPING TO 1320,23 IN SECTOR X!
  YOU'D BETTER GET HERE RIGHT AWAY!"

  Jazz discovers the location of Devan's destroyers!  Hurry, before Carrotus
  becomes space dust!

  FANOLINT -- Beneath the harsh surface of this wasteland is a thriving
  arbitorium in which the turtles are breeding Flowers of Death to feed their
  soldiers! Destroy them all, but watch out for Super-Tanks and plant life.

  SCRAPARAP -- This is the junkyard of the universe.  Here, the turtles are
  stealing metal and parts for their battleships with robotic droids. Destroy
  everything that moves, beware of the electro-magnets, and you might survive
  to find...

  DEVAN'S MEGAIRBASE -- Oh no! Devan has built an airbase! Jazz *might* have
  a chance at destroying the two areas if he avoids the tanks, missiles, and 
  super sparks! 

Episode 4:GENE MACHINE

  Jazz blew up the base, but Devan escaped with the princess in his tiny
  ship, leaving Jazz to crash in an unknown location... Shipless, Jazz soon 
  discovers that the turtles are cloning themselves with the SUPERCOPY 2000 
  Mean-Gene-Machine! And they've chosen a galaxy that's virtually untouched
  by modern technology as a breeding area. Looks like Jazz must put a stop 
  to this!

  TURTEMPLE -- The secret Temple of the Turtle! What luck! Now Jazz can
  cause some *real* trouble for Devan and his minions. Trash it, but beware
  of scorpions and cacti!
 
  NIPPIUS -- After ruining the Temple of the Turtle and stealing a Turtle
  Spacecraft, Jazz hops to the next planet- a *freezing* ball of ice infested
  with penguins and (you guessed it) Snow Turtles! Careful not to slip and
  slide into danger.

  JUNGROCK -- These temperature changes are going to give Jazz pneumonia!
  Now he is stuck on a steamy jungle planet, complete with enormous
  insects and serpents. As Jazz touches down on this planet he hears a
  shrill cry come from the end of the second area...  Whatever it is, it
  sounds mean!

Episode 5: The Chase is On!
  
  Jazz has Devan against the ropes. Strike first, strike fast, strike hard!

  MARBELARA -- This is the secret playground of Devan's elite
  SchwarzenGuards, a perfect place for them to play phaser-tag! Just make
  sure that you're not "it!"

  SLUGION -- The mazes within this planet house untold treasures... Guarded
  by Slugs and Dragoons! 

  DREEMPIPES -- This is the fuel refinery for Devan's destroyers! The entire 
  planet is covered with purple goo and Jazz must swim through it in order to 
  destroy Devan's handiwork. Shoot the switches to raise and lower the water 
  level!

Episode 6: The Final Clash
  
  At last, Devan's warships loom in the distance! Can Jazz hop, skip, and jump
  past two planets on the way?

  PEZROX -- Enormous concrete blocks form impregnable mazes that Jazz must 
  navigate while dodging lethal spiked balls. As the sun sets in the
  distance, Jazz can almost smell victory... Or is that Devan's feet?

  CRYSILIS -- Once a barren wasteland, now a shimmering gem in the night sky.
  Crysilis is Devan's depository for all of his (stolen) treasures... Time to
  raid it!

  TWIN MEGA BATTLESHIPS -- The turtles have built their crafts of
  destruction! A pair of ENORMOUS battleships loom in the distance, armed to 
  the teeth and ready to fight! Jazz must pilot his AirBoard, find a way into 
  each ship, and destroy the central CPUs. Beware of Hyper-Bees, Generators,
  and Armor-Doofi!
 
===================================================================
BESTIARY -- UGLY THINGS WILL CHASE YOU IN THIS GAME. WE WARNED YOU!
===================================================================

Episode 1: TURTLE TERROR!

<Diamondus>
  Turtle Goons: The first line of defense in Devan's lackeys. Not too smart, 
  they will aimlessly search for Jazz.

  Turtlettes: Tiny turtles that pose no immediate threat to Jazz.  They wander
  around looking for something to eat. Blast 'em anyways!

  BumblingBees: Oversized bees that have enormous eyes for finding Jazz and
  sharp stingers for when they do locate him! Ouch!

<Tubelectric>
  Spark: Similar to the famous "Will-o-the-wisps" but a lot faster and a lot
  meaner. Don't turn your back on them for a second!

  Floor and Ceiling Blasters: Defense turrets that Devan had set up as your
  welcome wagon.  You can stand on top of these guns, but you must avoid
  their shots!

  Spark-Barriers: Huge electric walls.  Jazz must blast 'em before he proceeds.

<Medivo>
  Helmuts: Turtles who lost their shells in battle, they've replaced the
  shells with giant helmets. They hop around looking for trouble.

  Ghost Rapiers: There are two types of these fierce sword-shaped baddies.
  The first Ghost Rapier flies straight at you, the second floats around
  seeking rabbit flesh.

Episode 2: BALLISTIC BUNNY

<Letni>
  Bugs: There are two types of bugs on Letni, the floor bugs and ceiling bugs.
  Mindless slaves of the enormous PC they're in, they will attack whatever
  approaches.

  Elec-Barriers: A smaller, more dangerous version of the Spark-Barriers. They
  take more hits, also!

<Technoir>
  TanketyTankTanks: These tanks are out of control! Devan's private tank
  guards are waiting for something to blast with their pineapple guns,
  and it might be YOU!

  Misfires: Teenage turtles decided to play a prank by jumping on missiles
  before they were fired. Unfortunately, they are now petrified by fear and 
  will not jump off of their missiles!

  MiniMines: Flying mine traps set by Devan just for you. They take a lot of
  shots, so start firing as soon as you see one!

<Orbitus>
  Beholders: These strange creatures come in two varieties: Purple and
  Silver. They are natural inhabitants of this planet and are unassociated
  with Devan Shell; and they will try to kill anything they see. And they
  see everything -- including you!

  SilverSnakes: It will take a full barrage of weaponry to take one of these 
  toughies out for good. Beware!

Episode 3: RABBIT'S REVENGE!

<Fanolint>
  Potted Plants: These prancing flowers dance the dance of death. They will
  fire in both directions, making them a fierce enemy! However, they are
  stuck in their pots and cannot come chasing after Jazz. Unlike...

  FlyFlowers: These CRAZED flowers have lost their stems! They are LIGHTNING
  fast and will cut down anything that gets in their way. Time to wack some 
  weeds.

  SuperTanketys: The TanketyTankTanks have been refined and are faster than
  ever. Look out!

<Scraparap>
  Robo-Turtle Drones: Tiny robotic turtles who move incredibly fast. They
  have the latest in Rabbit-Seeking technology, so they'll swarm you like
  a pack of hungry dogs!

  GunnerDrones: Devan put these guns here to defend the resources that he 
  intends on stealing. They fire incredibly fast bullets and will quickly
  take Jazz out if he's not careful.

  LaunchCarts: Touching these rovers will do no harm, however getting past
  them is another story! They will spout out bullets at Jazz relentlessly,
  so move quickly!

<Devan's Megairbase>
  Missiles: Large, rotund, fast, and highly explosive things will be flying
  at you every second. Don't get hit.

  DoofusGuards: Need we say more?

  SuperSparks: Remember the sparks? Devan liked the job they did, so he
  enlisted their evil cousins! These guys are FIERCE and will stop at nothing
  to zap Jazz's furry butt! Keep moving and you MIGHT survive!

Episode 4: GENE MACHINE

<TurTemple>
  JeTurtles: Jetpack-outfitted turtles will attempt to blast Jazz with their
  pea-shooters. They're quick!

  ScorpWeenies: Ticked off mutant scorpions. Dangerous.

  Boulderolls: These boulders don't harm Jazz, they just trip him up a bit.
  They can be used to Jazz's advantage when crossing dangerous areas!

<Nippius>
  SkiTurtles: Jet-Skiing turtles of death are screaming towards you! Move
  fast, or you won't last long.
  
  SkatePens: Someone taught these stupid Penguins how to skate. Now they
  work for Devan. Beware!

  SnoGoons: Mutant snowmen that are looking for lunch. Their enormous mouths 
  are just large enough to eat...a rabbit!

<JungRock>
  JetSnakes: Serpents that are outfitted with turbo speed. They are tough to 
  view in the lush jungle floor, so keep a sharp eye out for them.

  YellowBuzzers: Ugly. Mutant. Fly.

  RedBuzzers: Uglier. More Mutated. Flies faster. Need we say more?

Episode 5: THE CHASE IS ON!
 
<Marbelara>
  Schwarzengaurds: Devan's meanest and dumbest guards will shoot each
  other if they don't get you first!

  Drageens: Flying dragons that take many hits to destroy.

  Firebombs: Flaming bits of debris zoom up to singe Jazz!

<Slugion>
  RedBats: These tiny bats are made up of wings and eyes. Nothing else!

  Sluggi: Spotted slugs that will ooze their way towards Jazz with *bad*
  intentions.

  Dragoons: Little brothers of the drageens; they're smaller and slower,
  but they take several more shots.  Look out!

<Dreempipes>
  Terrapin-Swimmers: These turtles are at rest on land, but when the water
  level rises, watch your back: they wake up!

  Mines: There are two kinds of mines: OVERGROWNS and MINITES. The overgrowns 
  will bounce around looking for something to pierce, and the Minites will
  follow their big brother's patterns.

Episode 6: THE FINAL CLASH!

<Pez-Rox> 
  Clammys: Jet powered land and air clams that are looking for someone to
  bite.
  
  GreenSnakes: Their razor sharp fangs are aching to chomp some
  rabbit-butt!

<Crysilis>
  LooGuards: These are Devan's personal loogie-hocking guards! They will fly
  around on their AirBoards looking for Jazz. Let's not give them a target.

  GoldenBounceSpikes: Similar to the Bounce Spikes, these guys will float and
  bounce instead of land on the ground looking for Jazz. Tough as nails and 
  twice as sharp.

<Twin Mega Battleships>
  BounceSpikes: These used to be friendly balls that young bunnies would
  play with. Now, Devan has outfitted them with spikes and they're intent on 
  bouncing their way to Jazz!

  Generators: Flaming-bullet spouting machines from hell adorn the walls of
  Devan's ships. Approach with caution.

  Super-Bees: Remember all of those bees that you blew up in Diamondus?
  They're back, and they're mad! Devan has outfitted them with guns and
  turbo-butts, so they can attack twice as well!

  Armor-Doofi: Dumb, tough, and sword swinging armordillos guard the ships.
  Save your ammo for these baddies!

  CPU MONITORS: The driving PC on each battleship, it will start firing at
  Jazz the second it "sees" him. They take quite a few shots, but Jazz
  has to  destroy them in order to destroy the battleships!
