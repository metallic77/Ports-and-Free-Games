                     What's an Epic distribution site?
                     ---------------------------------

An Epic distribution site is a BBS that:

   * Features a special "Epic MegaGames" file section.
   * Carries all shareware games in the Epic product line.
   * Posts new Epic releases for download as soon as they're available.
   
             ---------------------------------------------------
             Why should my BBS become an Epic distribution site?
             ---------------------------------------------------

As an Epic distribution site,  you'll be able to attract new callers who
are looking for the latest and greatest shareware games.

   Plenty.  Thanks to Epic's new distribution partnerships, you can also
   sign up your BBS as a site for:

   SAFARI SOFTWARE,  a young new division of Epic MegaGames.  Safari will be
   bringing you the latest in small, innovative, high-quality games for
   your PC.  

   GAMEBYTES MAGAZINE,  an online gaming magazine dedicated to reviews,
   previews, and game tips.  GameBytes isn't related to Epic, but we're
   working together informally to gain more distribution for GameBytes and
   to bring Epic sites something new and innovative every month.

   An Epic MegaGames ANSI screen (EPIC.ANS) is included in the archive along
   with all Epic games.  Please feel free to post this screen on your BBS
   to promote your status as an Epic distribution site!
